# Web-Scraping-Goat üêê
**Context:**
Recently I followed the full freeCodeCamp crash course on web scraping and so I wanted to
see what I could do on my own with what I had learned. This project took me a couple hours,
but was lots of fun and I feel like I have learned lots from it. 

**How To Use:**
The install is very simple and only involves one file (GoatProject.py). Once you have that downloaded
you need to make sure you have the required libraries which are, requests, json, math, and contextlib.
Once you have both the file and the libraries installed, you can run it from any code editor or from
the command prompt. It takes in two inputs, a search query, and the amount of shoes you would like to search
for. It then displays the given number of shoes under the given search query. The program still has bugs,
if you find any or have any solutions or improvement ideas please let me know.
